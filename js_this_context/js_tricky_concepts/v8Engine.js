// ==========================
// 🔹 Practice 1: How JavaScript code runs
// ==========================
const runJsCode =
  "JavaScript code runs in three main stages:\n" +
  "1. Parsing: The V8 engine reads the code and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).\n" +
  "2. JIT Compilation: 'Just-In-Time' compilation converts JavaScript code into machine code for faster execution, instead of interpreting line by line.\n" +
  "3. Execution: The compiled machine code runs, and results are returned.";

/*
Explanation:
- Parsing: JS engine checks syntax and creates internal structures (AST)
- JIT Compilation: Optimizes code and improves performance
- Execution: Code executes in memory and produces output
*/

// ==========================
// 🔹 Practice 2: What V8 Engine does
// ==========================
const v8Engine =
  "V8 engine reads JavaScript code, parses it, compiles it just-in-time into machine code, and executes it efficiently.";

// ==========================
// 🔹 Practice 3: How JIT Compiler Works
// ==========================
const jitCompile =
  "JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is a mechanism in V8 that converts JavaScript code into optimized machine code at runtime. It makes JavaScript execution faster than purely interpreted execution.";
