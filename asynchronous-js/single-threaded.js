// Practice 1: What happens after calling a function in synchronous code?
const synchronous =
  "In synchronous code, functions are executed in a top-to-bottom serial order. When a function is called, the engine waits for it to finish completely before moving on to the next line of code. For example, if you print numbers 1 to 5 and call a function after number 2, the engine will execute that function fully before printing number 3.";

// Practice 2: Is JavaScript single-threaded?
const singleThreaded =
  "Yes, JavaScript is a single-threaded language. This means it has only one call stack and can execute only one command at a time in a single sequence.";
