// =====================
// Practice: JavaScript Error Types
// =====================

// Practice 1: SyntaxError
const syntaxError =
  "If we forget to add some symbols after finishing the code, such as a semicolon, comma, or bracket, then JavaScript returns a SyntaxError.";

// Practice 2: ReferenceError
const referenceError =
  "When we use a variable that has not been declared, JavaScript gives us a ReferenceError.";

// Practice 3: Difference between SyntaxError and TypeError
const diffSyntaxAndTypeError =
  "A SyntaxError occurs when something is missing in the code, such as a comma, semicolon, bracket, or when we use a JavaScript reserved keyword incorrectly. A TypeError occurs when an operation is performed on the wrong data type. For example, if a variable contains a number and we try to use toUpperCase() on it, JavaScript throws a TypeError because that method works only on strings.";
